## Description

This module is a replacement for the [puppet_metrics_dashboard module](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/puppet_metrics_dashboard).  It is used to configure Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana to collect, store, and display metrics collected from Puppet services. By default, those components are installed on a separate Dashboard node by applying the base class of this module to that node. That class will automatically query PuppetDB for Puppet Infrastructure nodes (Primary server, Compilers, PuppetDB hosts, PostgreSQL hosts) or you can specify them via associated class parameters. It is not recommended to apply the base class of this module to one of your Puppet Infrastructure nodes.


## Setup

### Prerequisites

### Note on air-gapped environments

If you are applying either the `puppet_operational_dashboards` or `puppet_operational_dashboards::telegraf::agent` classes to a node that cannot access the internet, it is possible to install packages from either an internal repository or archive sources located within the air gap.

### Internal repositories
To use internal repositories, set the following parameters.

For InfluxDB, the following parameters are configurable:

* [repo_url](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/influxdb/reference#repo_url) to point to a local URL
* [repo_gpg_key_url](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/influxdb/reference#repo_gpg_key_url) to point to a local URL with the repository's GPG key
* [repo_gpg_key_id](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/influxdb/reference#repo_gpg_key_id) to specify a different GPG key ID

Alternatively, you may set [manage_repo](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/influxdb/reference#manage_repo) to `false` to manage the repository configuration yourself.

For Grafana, the equivalent parameters are:

* [repo_url](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppet/grafana/reference#repo_url)
* [repo_gpg_key_url](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppet/grafana/reference#repo_gpg_key_url)
* [repo_key_id](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppet/grafana/reference#repo_key_id)
* [manage_package_repo](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppet/grafana/reference#manage_package_repo)

For Telegraf, the following parameters are available:

* [repo_location](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppet/telegraf/reference#repo_location)
* [manage_repo](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppet/telegraf/reference#manage_repo)

GPG options are currently not configurable.

Via Hiera it will look like this:

```yaml
influxdb::manage_repo: true
influxdb::archive_source: false
puppet_operational_dashboards::profile::dashboards::manage_grafana_repo: true
puppet_operational_dashboards::telegraf::agent::manage_archive: false
puppet_operational_dashboards::telegraf::agent::manage_repo: true
```

That will install all components via their upstream repositories. When you want
to use packages but manage repositories on your own, for example because you
use Katello or RedHat Satellite:

```yaml
influxdb::manage_repo: false
influxdb::archive_source: false
puppet_operational_dashboards::profile::dashboards::manage_grafana_repo: false
puppet_operational_dashboards::telegraf::agent::manage_archive: false
puppet_operational_dashboards::telegraf::agent::manage_repo: false
```

### Archive sources

To use archive sources, set the following parameters.  Note that support for Grafana archives has been deprecated and will need to be installed from a repository or package source.

For InfluxDB, set:

* [influxdb::manage_repo](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/influxdb/reference#manage_repo) to `false`
* [influxdb::archive_source](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/influxdb/reference#archive_source) to an internal URL containing the archive file for InfluxDB

For Grafana, set:

* [puppet_operational_dashboards::profile::dashboards::grafana_install](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/puppet_operational_dashboards/reference#grafana_install) to `package`.

Then, set [grafana::package_source](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppet/grafana/reference#package_source) to an internal URL containing a package for Grafana for your distribution.

For Telegraf, set:

* [puppet_operational_dashboards::telegraf::agent::manage_repo](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/puppet_operational_dashboards/reference#manage_repo) to `false`
* [puppet_operational_dashboards::telegraf::agent::manage_archive](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/puppet_operational_dashboards/reference#manage_archive) to `true`
* [puppet_operational_dashboards::telegraf::agent::archive_location](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/puppet_operational_dashboards/reference#archive_location) to an internal URL containing the archive file for Telegraf

### Beginning with puppet_operational_dashboards

#### Installing on Puppet Enterprise

To Install on Puppet Enterprise:

1. Classify `puppet_operational_dashboards::enterprise_infrastructure` to a node group that encompasses all Puppet Infrastructure agents. The default node group `PE Infrastructure Agent` is appropriate.

```
include puppet_operational_dashboards::enterprise_infrastructure
```

This will grant the appropriate access to the databases, for the dashboard node on all database nodes.

2. Classify `puppet_operational_dashboards` to the Puppet agent node to be designated as the Operational Dashboard node.

```
include puppet_operational_dashboards
```
This will install and configure Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana.


Please note database access will not be granted until the Puppet agent run on the postgres nodes AFTER the application of `puppet_operational_dashboards` on the designated dashboard node.


#### Installing on Puppet Open Source

To collect PostgreSQL metrics, FOSS users can apply the `puppet_operational_dashboards::profile::foss_postgres_access` class to any postgres nodes to configure authentication and grants for a `telegraf` user to connect.  This class has a dependency on the `puppetlabs/puppetdb` and `puppetlabs/postgresql` modules, and you must use the `puppetlabs/puppetdb` module to configure SSL for postgres.  See the documentation [here](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/puppetdb/readme#enable-ssl-connections).

You may also configure the connection options used by the Telegraf client when querying postgres.  These options can be set using the `puppet_operational_dashboards::telegraf::agent::postgres_options` class parameter.

The easiest way to get started using this module is by including the `puppet_operational_dashboards` class to install and configure Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana.

```
include puppet_operational_dashboards
```

#### What puppet_operational_dashboards affects
Installing the module will:

* Install and configure InfluxDB using the [puppetlabs/influxdb module](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/influxdb#what-influxdb-affects)
* Install and configure Telegraf to collect metrics from your PE infrastructure.  FOSS users can specify a list of infrastructure nodes via the `puppet_operational_dashboards::telegraf::agent` parameters.
* Install and configure Grafana with several dashboards to display data from InfluxDB

Note that this will save an InfluxDB administrative token to the user's home directory, typically `/root/.influxdb_token`.  The `puppetlabs/influxdb` types and providers can make use of this file during catalog application.  The manifests in this module are also able to use it via [deferred functions](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/7/deferring_functions.html), which also run on the agent as the first step of catalog application.  Therefore, it is possible to use this file for all token-based operations in this module, and no further configuration is required.

It is also possible to specify this token via the `influxdb::token` parameter in hiera.  The Telegraf token used by the `telegraf` service and Grafana datasource can also be set via `puppet_operational_dashboards::telegraf_token`.  These are both `Sensitive` strings, so the recommended way to use them is to encrypt them with [hiera-eyaml](https://github.com/voxpupuli/hiera-eyaml) and use the encrypted value in hiera data.  After setting up a hierarchy to use the [eyaml backend](https://github.com/voxpupuli/hiera-eyaml#with-hiera-5), the values can be added to hiera data and automatically converted to `Sensitive`:

```
influxdb::token: <eyaml_encrypted_string>
lookup_options:
   influxdb::token:
     convert_to: "Sensitive"
```

These parameters take precedence over the file on disk if both are specified.


## Usage

## Accessing Grafana

To access Grafana, use the following in your browser of choice: 
```http://[AGENT IP ADDRESS]:3000```

When first accessing Grafana, the default login and password are as follows:

Username: admin
Password: admin

Upon first sign in, you will then be prompted to change your password, skip this step and proceed to the dashboard.

### Evaluation order

When using the default configuration options and the deferred function to retreive the Telegraf token, note that it will not be available during the initial Puppet agent run that creates all of the resources.  A second run is required to retrieve the token and update the resources that use it.  If you are seeing authentication errors from Telegraf and Grafana, make sure the Puppet agent has been run twice and that the token has made its way to the Telegraf service config file:

```
/etc/systemd/system/telegraf.service.d/override.conf
```

### Determining where Telegraf runs

Which hosts a node collects metrics from is determined by the `puppet_operational_dashboards::telegraf::agent::collection_method` parameter.  By default, the `puppet_operational_dashboards` class will collect metrics from all nodes in a PE infrastructure.  If you want to change this behavior, set `collection_method` to `local` or `none`.  Telegraf can be run on other nodes by applying the `puppet_operational_dashboards::telegraf::agent` class to them, for example:

```
class {'puppet_operational_dashboards::telegraf::agent':
  collection_method => 'local',
  token => <my_sensitive_token>,
}
```

### Importing archive metrics

Metrics archives output by the [Puppet metrics collector](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/puppetlabs/puppet_metrics_collector) can be imported into InfluxDB using Telegraf and the scripts in the `examples/` directory.  See `ARCHIVES.md` for more.

### Limitations

## Ubuntu Telegraf Package
Currently, only the latest Telegraf package is provided by the Ubuntu repository.  Therefore, the only allowed value for `puppet_operational_dashboards::telegraf::agent::version` is `latest`.  Setting this parameter to a different value on Ubuntu will produce a warning.

## Upgrading from puppet_metrics_dashboard
This module uses InfluxDB 2.x, while `puppet_metrics_dashboard` uses 1.x.  This module does not currently provide an option to upgrade between these versions, so it is recommended to either install this module on a new node or manually upgrade.  See the [InfluxDB docs](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.2/upgrade/v1-to-v2/) for more information about upgrading.

## Applying classes on PE 2021.5 and 2021.6
On Puppet Enterprise versions 2021.5 and 2021.6, there is an issue when applying either the `puppet_operational_dashboards::enterprise_infrastructure` or `puppet_operational_dashboards::profile::postgres_access` classes in a user manifest.  Doing so may result in an error such as:

```
Error: Could not retrieve catalog from remote server: Error 500 on SERVER: Server Error: Evaluation Error: Error while evaluating a Resource Statement, Evaluation Error: Comparison of: Undef Value < Integer, is not possible. Caused by 'Only Strings, Numbers, Timespans, Timestamps, and Versions are comparable'
```

This is due to an ordering issue with the `cert_allowlist_entry` defined type.  The workaround is to apply the classes via the Console, for example by applying `puppet_operational_dashboards::enterprise_infrastructure` to the `PE Infrastructure Agent` node group.  See [Installing on Puppet Enterprise](#installing-on-puppet-enterprise).

This issue only affect PE versions 2021.5 and 2021.6.  Earlier versions are not affected, and later releases will include a fix to the defined type.

## Installing on openSUSE 15
On some versions of openSUSE 15, the `insserv-compat` package may be required to enable the Grafana service.  If you see an error such as:

```
Error: /Stage[main]/Grafana::Service/Service[grafana]/ensure: change from 'stopped' to 'running' failed: Could not enable grafana-server:
```

This is due to the missing package:

```
Synchronizing state of grafana-server.service with SysV service script with /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install.
Executing: /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install enable grafana-server
/sbin/insserv: No such file or directory
```

Installing the `insserv-compat` resolves the error.
### Troubleshooting
If data is not displaying in Grafana or you see errors in Telegraf collections, try checking the following items.

## Grafana datasource and time interval
A common reason for not seeing data in the dashboards is choosing the wrong datasource or time interval.  Double check that you have selected a datasource and window of time for which metrics have been collected.  Also, check that the `server` filter at the top of the dashboard contains valid entries.

Also, note that Telegraf performs its first collection after the first collection interval has passed.  You may need to wait for this to pass, or manually test using the method below.

Datasources can be tested via the "Data Sources" configuration page in Grafana.  Select the datasource, e.g. `influxdb_puppet`, and click the "Test" button.  Note that because this is a "provisioned datasource," it cannot be edited in the UI.

## Telegraf errors
A good way to test Telegraf collection is to use the `--test` option.  After logging into the node running `telegraf`, first export your token:
```
export INFLUX_TOKEN=<token>
```

The token can either be the admin token written to `/root/.influxdb_token` by default, or the `puppet telegraf token` used specifically for Telegraf.  See `REFERENCE.md` for more information.

Prepending a space before the `export` command will prevent the token from being written to you shell's history.

Then, test the collection:
```
telegraf --test --debug --config /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf --config-directory /etc/telegraf/telegraf.d/
```

Services can also be tested individually, for example:

```
telegraf --test --debug --config /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf --config /etc/telegraf/telegraf.d/puppetserver_metrics.conf
```

will only collect Puppet server metrics.
